## Covid-19 Project

Team Members: Lily Da, Sukhi Kaur, Lena Thongdara, John Nguyen & Francisco Lim

Project Description: We will focus on Covid-19 datasets in relation to the United States. 

Research Questions to Answer: 
  - What is the impact of Covid-19 as a population in the United States?
  - Did Covid-19 have an effect on unemployment?
  - How many people quit or were laid off? (what is the correlation?) 
  * Bonus: How inclined were people to get the booster after being fully vaccinated for Covid-19?

Datasets to be Used: https://covid19.who.int/data


## Final Analysis
Our presentation highlights COVID-19 vaccination distribution in 2021, with China leading at 47.8%, followed by India (30%), the USA (9.1%), Brazil (7%), and Indonesia (6.1%). It emphasizes the USA’s lower vaccination inclination compared to China and India. The global perspective on booster shots reveals China’s highest inclination (60.6%), followed by India (16.6%), the USA (8.5%), Brazil (8%), and Japan (6.3%). China administered an impressive 3.52 billion vaccinations and 833,820,382 boosters, while the USA administered 668,882,018 vaccinations with 116,629,517 boosters. A bar chart depicts COVID-19's varying impact, with spikes and dips in cases throughout the year. Data is from the World Health Organization and Bureau of Labor Statistics, analyzing 2021 mortality, terminations, and voluntary departures. Mortality-related workforce changes affected the economy, and reduced job terminations correlated with declining mortality, though this correlation reversed in July. People left jobs for various reasons, including safety concerns, remote work challenges, and government support. Further data analysis is needed for comprehensive insights.
